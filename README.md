# My-Portfolio

## This website is designed to be place where I may showcase my work as a web developer.
<br/>

### -The header holds my name and navigation links to sections of the site. Withing the main content of the page is a picture of myself and a brief description of me and my professional development. Below that is a gallery of my current projects with a link to the site itself. Finally it ends with a link to reach me via email. 
<br/>


###### -This is a work in progress and will continue to grow as I improve throughout my training and professional career. I zm not sure why my screenshot link is not working so i comented it out so it could be seen...
